# Methylation Station

This application is for analyzing and visualizing DNA methylation data.

It is built for client-side JavaScript in a web browser.  Data is never
uploaded anywhere, just selected by the user and read from the local disk.

[AngularJS][] 1.x provides the framework for reactive controllers and views,
and several third-party libraries provide data manipulation and visualization
tools:

* [D3][] (`d3`) 3.x
* [Vega][] (`vg`) 2.x
* [Datalib][] (`dl`) 0.1.x

The user interface uses HTML5, CSS, and [Bootstrap][] 3.x.  SVG is used for
drawing.
