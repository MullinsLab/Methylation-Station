# Methylation Station

This application is for analyzing and visualizing DNA methylation data.

It is built for client-side JavaScript in a web browser.  Data is never
uploaded anywhere, just selected by the user and read from the local disk.

AngularJS 1.x provides the framework for reactive controllers and views, and
several third-party libraries provide data manipulation and visualization
tools:

* D3 (`d3`) 3.x
* Vega (`vg`) 2.x
* Datalib (`dl`) 0.1.x

The user interface uses HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap 3.x.  SVG is used for
drawing.
